Key Changes:
Avoid Intermediate File Saves:
No intermediate files (cleaned_hospital_data.csv, etc.) are saved.
Each cleaned dataset (e.g., hospital data, physician data) is processed in memory and directly merged.
Final Datasets:
predictors_data: Contains all predictor variables (hospital beds, hospitals per million inhabitants, physicians).
waiting_times_data: Contains wait times by medical procedure.
File Outputs:
Only the final datasets are saved to ./data/02-analysis_data/ in both CSV and Parquet formats.
Improved Readability:
Each dataset is processed in a single logical step (e.g., loading, filtering, renaming, arranging).
Merging is done after all predictors are cleaned.
Example Output Datasets
Predictors Data (predictors_data)

Year	HospitalsPerMillionInhabitants	NumberPhysicians	HospitalBedsPer1000Inhabitants
2015	3.2	150000	2.5
2016	3.1	152000	2.6
2017	3.0	155000	2.4
Waiting Times Data (waiting_times_data)

Year	WaitTime	Medical.procedure
2015	24.5	Coronary artery bypass
2015	30.6	Hip replacement
2016	22.7	Knee replacement
Benefits of this Approach
Streamlined Workflow: Reduces unnecessary file I/O operations.
Reproducibility: Ensures that only final datasets are saved and used for analysis.
Efficiency: Processes data in memory, avoiding multiple save/load operations.

Explanation
Waiting Times Transformation:
The waiting_times_data is transformed using pivot_wider() to create a separate column for each medical procedure's wait time. Columns are named as WaitTime_<Medical.procedure>.
Predictors Merge:
The predictors (hospital_data, physician_data, beds_data) are merged using left_join() on the Year column.
The final merge includes the transformed waiting_times_data.
Output:
The combined dataset (final_data) contains all predictors and wait times in a single table.
File Save:
The dataset is saved as both a CSV and Parquet file for compatibility and performance.
Example Output
Year	HospitalsPerMillionInhabitants	NumberPhysicians	HospitalBedsPer1000Inhabitants	WaitTime_CoronaryArteryBypass	WaitTime_HipReplacement	WaitTime_KneeReplacement
2015	3.2	150000	2.5	24.5	30.6	22.7
2016	3.1	152000	2.6	23.8	29.5	23.5
2017	3.0	155000	2.4	22.7	28.9	21.4
Benefits
Unified Dataset: All variables, including predictors and wait times, are in a single file for easier analysis.
Clear Wait Time Representation: Each medical procedure has its own column for wait times.
Ready for Analysis: The dataset is well-structured for statistical modeling or visualization.

Explanation
Renaming Columns:
Only the specified columns (WaitTime_Coronary artery bypass graft, etc.) are renamed to shorter versions (e.g., WaitTime_Coronary_Graft).
The rename() function ensures other columns remain unchanged.
Saving Final Dataset:
The updated dataset is saved as final_healthcare_data_renamed.csv and final_healthcare_data_renamed.parquet.
Verification:
summary(final_data) provides a quick overview to verify the dataset structure.
colnames(final_data) lists all column names to confirm the renaming.

ChatGPT said:
Here’s how you can import the cleaned data from the specified CSV file and display a summary in your R script:

R Script to Import and Summarize Data
#### Workspace setup ####
library(tidyverse)

#### Import cleaned data ####
# Import the final cleaned healthcare dataset
cleaned_data <- read_csv("./data/02-analysis_data/final_healthcare_data.csv")

#### Summary of the cleaned data ####
# View the summary
summary(cleaned_data)

# Optional: View the first few rows
head(cleaned_data)

# Optional: Check the structure of the dataset
str(cleaned_data)
Expected Output
summary(cleaned_data): This will show:
For numeric columns: Min, 1st Quartile, Median, Mean, 3rd Quartile, Max.
For character/factor columns: Frequency counts.
head(cleaned_data): Displays the first few rows of the dataset for quick verification.
str(cleaned_data): Shows the structure of the dataset, including column names, types, and a preview of data values.
Notes
Make sure that the file final_healthcare_data.csv exists in the specified path (./data/02-analysis_data/).
If any column names in the CSV include spaces or special characters, you may need to reference them using backticks (e.g., `WaitTime_Coronary Graft`).
Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further clarification!






You said:
make it similar to this 
{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| label: tbl-data
#| tbl-cap: "A summary table of cleaned data"

library(knitr)
kable(merged_data)
ChatGPT said:
To present your cleaned data in a similar format, here’s how you can use the knitr::kable() function to generate a nicely formatted summary table:

Code to Import and Display Cleaned Data
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| label: tbl-data
#| tbl-cap: "A summary table of the cleaned healthcare data"

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

# Import the cleaned healthcare dataset
cleaned_data <- read_csv("./data/02-analysis_data/final_healthcare_data.csv")

# Display the cleaned data as a formatted table
kable(head(cleaned_data), 
      caption = "A preview of the cleaned healthcare data")
Explanation
kable:
The knitr::kable() function formats the first few rows of the dataset (head(cleaned_data)) into a readable table.
The caption parameter adds a descriptive title.
R Markdown Chunk Options:
echo: false: Hides the code block from the output.
warning: false: Suppresses warnings for a clean display.
label and tbl-cap: Label and caption metadata for the table.
Output:
The table will render in the final R Markdown output with a caption ("A preview of the cleaned healthcare data") and display the first few rows of cleaned_data.
Optional: Add Summary Statistics
If you'd like to include a summary table (e.g., mean, median for numeric columns), you can add this:

#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| label: tbl-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics of the cleaned healthcare data"

# Compute summary statistics
summary_stats <- cleaned_data |>
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), list(mean = mean, sd = sd, min = min, max = max), .names = "{.col}_{.fn}"))

# Display summary statistics as a table
kable(summary_stats, 
      caption = "Summary statistics of the cleaned healthcare data")
Output
Preview Table (tbl-data): Displays the first few rows of the cleaned dataset.
Summary Table (tbl-summary): Shows computed summary statistics (e.g., mean, SD, min, max) for all numeric columns.
Let me know if you’d like further assistance or adjustments!






You said:
my table is very wide, is there a way to make it display in parts under each other. 
ChatGPT said:
Yes, when the table is too wide, you can split it into smaller, more readable parts and display them under each other in an R Markdown document. Here's how you can achieve this:

Code to Split and Display a Wide Table in Parts
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| label: tbl-split-data
#| tbl-cap: "A summary table of the cleaned healthcare data displayed in parts"

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

# Import the cleaned healthcare dataset
cleaned_data <- read_csv("./data/02-analysis_data/final_healthcare_data.csv")

# Split the table into smaller parts
# For example, split into first half of columns and second half of columns
part1 <- cleaned_data[, 1:5]  # Adjust column indices as needed
part2 <- cleaned_data[, 6:ncol(cleaned_data)]

# Display the first part of the table
kable(head(part1), 
      caption = "Part 1: First set of columns from the cleaned healthcare data")

# Display the second part of the table
kable(head(part2), 
      caption = "Part 2: Second set of columns from the cleaned healthcare data")
Explanation
Splitting the Data:
part1 contains the first subset of columns (e.g., the first 5 columns).
part2 contains the remaining columns.
Adjust column indices (1:5, 6:ncol(cleaned_data)) based on your dataset structure.
Display Using kable:
Each part of the table is displayed separately using kable().
You can add captions to clarify what each part represents.
Dynamic Splitting (Optional):
If the number of columns in the dataset is very large, you can dynamically split into equal parts:
# Dynamically split into chunks of 5 columns
split_tables <- split(seq_len(ncol(cleaned_data)), ceiling(seq_len(ncol(cleaned_data)) / 5))

# Loop through each chunk and display as separate tables
for (i in seq_along(split_tables)) {
  part <- cleaned_data[, split_tables[[i]], drop = FALSE]
  kable(head(part), caption = paste("Part", i, ": Subset of columns"))
}
Output
Part 1: Displays the first 5 columns in the table.
Part 2: Displays the next set of columns.
This approach keeps your table readable and organized. Let me know if you'd like to further customize this!






You said:
can you separate the columns from each other some more
ChatGPT said:
To increase the spacing between columns and make the table more visually distinct, you can adjust the formatting options within kable(). By using the kableExtra package, you can add custom column separation and other formatting enhancements.

Solution Using kableExtra
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| label: tbl-split-data-spaced
#| tbl-cap: "A summary table of the cleaned healthcare data displayed with wider column spacing"

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Import the cleaned healthcare dataset
cleaned_data <- read_csv("./data/02-analysis_data/final_healthcare_data.csv")

# Split the table into parts (first and second set of columns)
part1 <- cleaned_data[, 1:5]  # Adjust column indices as needed
part2 <- cleaned_data[, 6:ncol(cleaned_data)]

# Display the first part of the table with increased spacing
kable(head(part1), 
      caption = "Part 1: First set of columns from the cleaned healthcare data") |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center") |>
  column_spec(1:5, width = "3cm")  # Adjust width as needed

# Display the second part of the table with increased spacing
kable(head(part2), 
      caption = "Part 2: Second set of columns from the cleaned healthcare data") |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center") |>
  column_spec(1:5, width = "3cm")  # Adjust width as needed
Explanation
kable_styling:
full_width = FALSE: Ensures the table does not stretch across the full page width.
position = "center": Centers the table on the page.
column_spec:
Specifies the width of each column.
The width parameter (e.g., "3cm") increases the spacing between columns. Adjust this value as needed to achieve the desired separation.
Splitting the Table:
The dataset is split into two parts (part1 and part2) to manage wide tables and ensure readability.
Output Example
Part 1:
Columns are displayed with extra spacing.
Each column is approximately 3 cm wide (customizable).
Part 2:
The remaining columns are displayed similarly with increased spacing.
Optional: Dynamic Spacing for Large Tables
If the table has many columns and you want to dynamically separate and style all subsets:

# Dynamically split into chunks of 5 columns
split_tables <- split(seq_len(ncol(cleaned_data)), ceiling(seq_len(ncol(cleaned_data)) / 5))

# Loop through each chunk and display with spacing
for (i in seq_along(split_tables)) {
  part <- cleaned_data[, split_tables[[i]], drop = FALSE]
  kable(head(part), caption = paste("Part", i, ": Subset of columns")) |>
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center") |>
    column_spec(1:ncol(part), width = "3cm")
}

Key Changes
Population Data Integration:
The population_estimate.parquet file is loaded and filtered for 2015–2019.
Population estimates are joined with the main dataset.
Physicians per 1000 Population:
A new column, physicians_per_1000, is calculated by dividing the total number of physicians by the population (scaled to 1000).
The original number_physicians and Population columns are removed to avoid redundancy.
Column Renaming:
Waiting time columns are renamed for better readability (Wait_CorGraft, Wait_Angioplasty, etc.).
Output:
The final dataset is saved as final_healthcare_data.csv and final_healthcare_data.parquet.
Example Final Dataset
Year	hospitals_per_1000000	beds_per_1000	physicians_per_1000	Wait_CorGraft	Wait_Angioplasty	Wait_Knee	Wait_Hip	Wait_Cataract	Wait_Prostatectomy	Wait_Hysterectomy
2015	28.9	2.61	2.32	24.5	12	45	28.1	6.6	41.8	28.4
2016	29.28	2.57	2.34	24.7	15.8	49.5	31.6	5.7	46.6	31.6
Benefits
Normalized Physicians Statistic: The number of physicians is now more meaningful when compared across years.
Comprehensive Dataset: All predictors and outcomes are merged into a single, well-structured file.
Ready for Analysis: The dataset is clean and formatted for statistical modeling or visualization.

Warning message:
There were 2 warnings in filter().
The first warning was:
ℹ In argument: as.numeric(Title) >= 2015 & as.numeric(Title) <= 2019.
Caused by warning:
! NAs introduced by coercion
ℹ Run dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings() to see the 1 remaining warning. 
> View(population_estimate)
> View(population_estimate)
ChatGPT said:
The issue arises because the Title column contains text data instead of numeric years, so attempting to coerce it to numeric with as.numeric() results in NA values. This happens because the column also contains non-year entries like metadata (e.g., "United Kingdom population mid-year estimate").

To fix this, you should first filter out rows where Title contains non-numeric data. Here's how you can adjust your code:

Updated Code for Population Data Processing
# 5. Load and process the population data
population_data <- read_parquet("./data/01-raw_data/population_estimate.parquet") |>
  # Keep only rows where Title can be converted to numeric
  filter(!is.na(as.numeric(Title))) |>
  # Convert Title to numeric and filter by year range
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Title)) |>
  filter(Year >= 2015 & Year <= 2019) |>
  # Select relevant columns
  select(Year, Population = `United Kingdom population mid-year estimate`)
Explanation of Fix
Filter Out Non-Numeric Title Values:
Use filter(!is.na(as.numeric(Title))) to exclude rows where Title cannot be coerced to numeric.
Convert Title to Numeric:
After filtering, safely convert Title to numeric and rename it to Year for clarity.
Filter by Year Range:
Apply the filter condition (Year >= 2015 & Year <= 2019) on the numeric Year column.
Select Relevant Columns:
Keep only Year and Population for further merging with other datasets.
Expected Output
This will result in a clean population_data dataframe with only the years 2015–2019 and corresponding population estimates. It will be ready to merge with your other datasets.

Warning message:
There was 1 warning in filter().
ℹ In argument: !is.na(as.numeric(Title)).
Caused by warning:
! NAs introduced by coercion 
ChatGPT said:
The warning persists because as.numeric(Title) still attempts to coerce non-numeric values (like "United Kingdom population mid-year estimate") into numeric values, resulting in NAs.

We can resolve this issue more robustly by ensuring we apply the filter() condition in a way that avoids coercion warnings. Here's an updated approach:

Updated Code Without Warnings
# Load and process the population data
population_data <- read_parquet("./data/01-raw_data/population_estimate.parquet") |>
  # Filter rows where Title matches only numeric year patterns
  filter(str_detect(Title, "^\\d{4}$")) |>
  # Convert Title to numeric and rename it to Year
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Title)) |>
  # Filter by the desired year range
  filter(Year >= 2015 & Year <= 2019) |>
  # Select relevant columns
  select(Year, Population = `United Kingdom population mid-year estimate`)
Explanation of Changes
Filter Only Numeric Years Using str_detect():
The condition str_detect(Title, "^\\d{4}$") matches rows where Title contains exactly four numeric digits (e.g., "2015").
This avoids attempting to coerce non-numeric values into numeric form, eliminating the warning.
Convert Title to Year:
Once we know the rows contain valid years, safely convert Title to numeric with mutate(Year = as.numeric(Title)).
Filter by Year Range:
Keep rows where the numeric Year is between 2015 and 2019.
Select Relevant Columns:
Retain only the Year and Population columns for use in your analysis.
Why This Works
Using str_detect() ensures that only rows with valid numeric year strings are processed further, avoiding the problematic coercion of non-numeric values (e.g., metadata or column titles).

Error in mutate():
ℹ In argument: physicians_per_1000 = number_physicians/(Population/1000).
Caused by error in Population / 1000:
! non-numeric argument to binary operator
Run rlang::last_trace() to see where the error occurred.
ChatGPT said:
The error occurs because the Population column might still be stored as a character type instead of numeric, preventing mathematical operations. This can happen if the original column has formatting issues (e.g., commas in the numbers or non-numeric entries).

Solution
Ensure that the Population column is correctly converted to numeric before using it in calculations. Here's how to fix it:

Corrected Code for Population Data and Final Merging
# 5. Load and process the population data
population_data <- read_parquet("./data/01-raw_data/population_estimate.parquet") |>
  # Filter rows where Title matches only numeric year patterns
  filter(str_detect(Title, "^\\d{4}$")) |>
  # Convert Title to numeric and rename it to Year
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Title)) |>
  # Ensure Population column is numeric (remove commas if necessary)
  mutate(Population = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", `United Kingdom population mid-year estimate`))) |>
  # Filter by the desired year range
  filter(Year >= 2015 & Year <= 2019) |>
  # Select relevant columns
  select(Year, Population)

# 6. Merge all predictors with wait times and population
final_data <- hospital_data |>
  left_join(physician_data, by = "Year") |>
  left_join(beds_data, by = "Year") |>
  left_join(waiting_times_data, by = "Year") |>
  left_join(population_data, by = "Year") |>
  # Calculate physicians per 1000 population
  mutate(
    physicians_per_1000 = number_physicians / (Population / 1000)
  ) |>
  # Drop redundant columns
  select(-number_physicians, -Population)
Explanation of Changes
Ensure Population is Numeric:
Use gsub(",", "", ...) to remove commas from the Population values if they exist (e.g., "56,928,000").
Convert the cleaned Population values to numeric with as.numeric().
Verify Numeric Operations:
After ensuring Population is numeric, mathematical operations like / can be applied without errors.
Merge and Clean:
The rest of the merging and calculation process remains unchanged, but now the physicians_per_1000 calculation will work without issues.
Debugging Tip
If this still fails, verify the Population column immediately after processing:

# Check the structure and values of population_data
str(population_data)
head(population_data)

You said:
I want wait times to be the last few columns in my table 
ChatGPT said:
To ensure that the wait time columns appear as the last columns in your final table, you can rearrange the columns after merging all the datasets. Here's how you can do it:

Updated Code to Reorder Columns
# 6. Merge all predictors with wait times and population
final_data <- hospital_data |>
  left_join(physician_data, by = "Year") |>
  left_join(beds_data, by = "Year") |>
  left_join(population_data, by = "Year") |>
  left_join(waiting_times_data, by = "Year") |>
  # Calculate physicians per 1000 population
  mutate(
    physicians_per_1000 = number_physicians / (Population / 1000)
  ) |>
  # Drop redundant columns
  select(-number_physicians, -Population) |>
  # Rearrange columns: predictors first, wait times last
  select(
    Year, 
    hospitals_per_1000000, 
    beds_per_1000, 
    physicians_per_1000, 
    starts_with("WaitTime_")  # All wait time columns
  )
Explanation
Reordering Columns:
select() is used to explicitly order columns.
Non-wait time predictors (Year, hospitals_per_1000000, beds_per_1000, physicians_per_1000) are placed first.
All columns starting with WaitTime_ are moved to the end using starts_with().
Dynamic Column Selection:
starts_with("WaitTime_") ensures all wait time columns are selected, regardless of their specific names.
Final Table Structure:
Predictors appear first in the table, followed by all wait time columns.



write a paragraph in similar format but with the correct analysis for the plots attached:
The projection plots highlight how the linear model predicts the percentage increase in wait times (Pct_Wait_Avg) based on three key predictors: attendance, physicians_per_1000, and beds_per_1000. The red lines represent the model's predictions, while the blue points indicate the actual data values. Among the predictors, beds_per_1000 shows the strongest fit to the model, as the data points align closely with the negative trend indicated by the red line. This suggests that beds_per_1000 is the most influential predictor of wait times, a conclusion further supported by its significant coefficient in @tbl-modelresults. Attendance also captures the predicted relationship effectively, with a positive trend between higher attendance and increased wait times, though its influence is less pronounced than that of beds_per_1000. In contrast, physicians_per_1000 exhibits the least effect, as the actual data points show more variability around the red line, and the slope of the prediction line is relatively flat, indicating a weaker relationship. Overall, beds_per_1000 emerges as the most impactful predictor, followed by attendance, while physicians_per_1000 has minimal influence on wait times.
ChatGPT said:

The red lines denote the model's predicted trends, while the blue points represent the actual observed data. The predictor attendance demonstrates a positive relationship with wait times, where increasing attendance aligns closely with the model's predictions, as shown by the clustering of blue points around the upward-sloping red line. Physicians_per_1000 shows a weaker association, with greater variability in the blue points around the red line, indicating that this predictor has a less consistent effect on wait times despite the positive slope of the trend. Beds_per_1000, on the other hand, exhibits a strong negative relationship, with the blue points aligning closely with the downward-sloping red line, reaffirming its significant impact on reducing wait times. These visual trends reinforce the findings in @tbl-modelresults, emphasizing beds_per_1000 as the most influential predictor, followed by attendance, while physicians_per_1000 has a relatively minor effect on wait times.

The red lines depict the predicted relationships, while the blue points represent the observed data values. The attendance predictor shows a clear positive relationship with wait times, as indicated by the upward-sloping red line, and most data points align reasonably well with the model's trend. Physicians_per_1000 also demonstrates a positive trend, but the variability in the observed data points around the red line suggests a weaker fit compared to attendance. In contrast, beds_per_1000 shows minimal association with wait times, with the red line nearly flat and the data points scattered without a clear trend. These plots suggest that attendance is the most influential predictor of wait times among the three variables, while beds_per_1000 has the least impact.

analyse these residual plots
ChatGPT said:
The diagnostic residual plots for the linear model provide insights into the model's assumptions and performance:

Residuals vs Attendance: The residuals appear randomly scattered around the zero line, suggesting no obvious pattern or non-linearity. However, there is one point with a large residual, which could indicate a potential outlier.
Residuals vs Physicians per 1,000: Similarly, the residuals are scattered around zero without a clear trend, which supports the assumption of linearity. Nonetheless, one residual stands out significantly, suggesting the possibility of an influential data point that might disproportionately affect the model fit.
Residuals vs Beds per 1,000: The residuals here also appear randomly distributed around zero, with no distinct pattern, indicating that the linear model adequately captures the relationship for this predictor. However, some variation is still observed, and there is one notable outlier.
Fitted vs Actual Values: The fitted vs. actual values plot shows that most points cluster near the dashed red line, representing a good fit of the model. However, there are a few points that deviate significantly from the line, indicating discrepancies between the predicted and actual values, potentially arising from outliers or heteroscedasticity.
Summary:
The residual plots suggest that the linear model generally fits the data well, with no major violations of the assumptions of linearity or independence. However, the presence of outliers and potential influential points should be investigated further, as they might affect the model's robustness and accuracy. Additionally, given the small sample size, these observations should be interpreted cautiously.

rewrite this to correspond with the information in the screenshot:
The linear regression model, presented in @tbl-modelresults, reveals significant relationships between healthcare system factors and the percentage increase in wait times, with all variables demonstrating p-values below 0.05. The number of hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants has a strong negative effect (\beta = −75.36), indicating that as bed availability decreases, wait times increase substantially. Physician availability per 1,000 (\beta = 29.99) shows a smaller but significant positive effect, suggesting that higher physician counts might correlate with increased demand or potential delays in service delivery. Similarly, attendance rates exhibit a significant positive effect (\beta = 1.45), highlighting the strain that growing patient loads place on healthcare systems. The model achieves an $R^2$ value of 1.000, suggesting it explains nearly all variability in the data. However, this result should be interpreted cautiously given the small sample size (n = 8), which raises concerns about potential overfitting and limits the model’s generalizability. Overall, these findings emphasize the critical importance of resource availability, particularly hospital bed capacity, in mitigating healthcare wait times.

The linear regression model, presented in @tbl-modelresults, explores the relationships between healthcare system factors and the percentage change in wait times, though none of the variables demonstrate statistically significant effects, as indicated by p-values greater than 0.05. The number of hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants shows a small positive effect (β=4.71), suggesting a minimal increase in wait times with higher bed availability, though this effect lacks statistical significance. Physician availability per 1,000 (β=31.83) indicates a larger positive association, yet it is also not statistically significant. Attendance rates (β=0.40) exhibit the smallest positive effect, suggesting a weak association with wait times. The model achieves an R^2 value of 0.599, indicating that approximately 60% of the variability in wait times is explained by the model, though the adjusted R^2 value of 0.299 reflects limited predictive power. With a sample size of n=8, the findings should be interpreted cautiously, as the lack of significance and low adjusted R^2 highlight potential limitations in the model's robustness and generalizability.
